# Lecture Notes

## Session 1

- Intro to Pandas and Data Visualization
- Focus on Data Wrangling and the goal Visualizations
- Focus on clarity of your message and amplify it with a clear visual
- Outlook to a good example of solid data and focused visualization


## Session 2

- Intro to goals of group project and prototyping process
- Data Gathering and Data Wrangling from CLI to Notebook to Application
- Utlimate target: Realtime Data in an Interactive Web Application


## Session 3

Theory:
- Intro to the Theory and Nested Model of Visualization Analysis and Design

Exercise:
- Showing the setup of a Data Visualization Web App with Pandas, HTML, CSS, JS (D3.js)
- Created a heatmap with pands (pivot_table) and a heatmap with seaborn
- Displayed Image of heatmap in HTML File
- Underlined that full data pipe line is missing, visual design is still off, and that document is not accessible nor semantic with just an image showing

Homework:
- Find a way to display all students in the heatmap
- Change colors (maybe size and fonts if necessary) to make display clearer

## Session 4

NO CLASS

## Session 5
- TEAM PRESENTATIONS

## Session 6

Theory:
- Data and Task Abstractions are fundamental for translating problem domain to actual implementation logic
- They offer a precise language to describe requirements for a visualization based on user needs
- Data Abstractions look at the options for different data structures at the basis of visualizations
- Task Abstractions look at the combination of Action and Target to narrowly define the requirements for the frontend

Exercise:
- Discussion of Homework: How to get from Pivot Table with absolute values to a mixed display
